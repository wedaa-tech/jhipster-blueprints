Docker compose files are provided for the same to get started quickly.

Component details:
<%_ if (oauth2) { _%>

<%_ } _%>

## Get Started

Run the prototype locally in development mode: `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>](http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

## Containerization

Build the docker image: `docker build -t <%= baseName %>:latest .`

Start the container: `docker run -d -p <%= serverPort %>:80 <%= baseName %>:latest`
